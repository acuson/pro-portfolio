# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

This represents the first draft of my professional portfolio. I plan to make changes to it over time and will update the README.md file accordingly as I progress.

# Functionality Highlights
* Presented with a header along with navigation links. When you click on the links, it takes you to the corresponding section.
* The About Me section contains a headshot of myself, along with a snipet of the purpose of the portfolio along with my career background and goals.
* The Work Section presents five projects to showcase my work thus far. When you click on the image, it takes you to the deployed application.
* The portfolio concludes with a footer that serves as the content section. There are links on the right side that you can click to take to the corresponding URL if applicable.

# Files
* This application includes a README.md, index.html, and an assets folder.
    * The assets folder includes style.css and seven images used throughout the application
* The index.html file uses semantic HTML elements and proper heading usage to keep the file organized and thorough.
* The style.css file includes quality comments to explain styling, flexboxes, and media query.

Here is a link to the deployed application: https://acuson.github.io/pro-portfolio/
